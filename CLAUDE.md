# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running and testing

**No build step.** Open `index.html` directly in a browser — `file://` works because there are no ES modules.

**Smoke tests** (require Node.js + jsdom):
```sh
npm install jsdom          # one-time
node tools/smoke.test.js   # core engine tests
node tools/smoke2.test.js  # deep content + engines tests
node tools/smoke3.test.js  # Build 2a governor: SM-2, sessions, economy, calendar, todo
node tools/smoke4.test.js  # Build 3a Collection Matrix: mediadb, AniList client, XML import
node tools/smoke5.test.js  # Build 3b Books: dual-tracking schema, v2→v3 migration, manga sync/XML, physical vault
node tools/smoke6.test.js  # Build 3c Visual Novels: VN schema, v3→v4 migration, VNDB client, personal flashcard bucket
node tools/smoke7.test.js  # Build 3d write-back: push utility, mutation shapes, search-and-add, quick-edit
node tools/smoke8.test.js  # Build 3e Games: v5 schema, bulk paste-in, analytics, cross-media integration, Steam-absence invariants
node tools/smoke9.test.js  # Build 3f Anime deepening: season calc, extra-merge fix, airing countdown (mocked), watch heatmap, AniList profile
node tools/smoke10.test.js # Build 3h: the VNDB duplication regression (real /ulist shape), title-claim fallback, dedup pass, import modes
node tools/smoke11.test.js # Build 3i Books deepening: lookup clients (Open Library/Google Books), ISBN utils, tab split + comparison survival, reading sessions (governor boundary), ranked shelves, scanner degradation
node tools/smoke12.test.js # Build 3j: reward-on-sync watermark (the push→echoing-pull single-reward property), autosync engine, VN chapters, profile tabs + VNDB profile, shop rebalance + Matrix cosmetics, season picker
node tools/smoke13.test.js # R3 full-coverage backup/restore: mediadb exportAll/importAll, attachments, store.importFull (v2 + legacy), token exclusion, round-trip
node tools/smoke14.test.js # Build 3g Purchase/Budget Planner: budget maths (shared pool + simulation + over-budget), purchase archiving + spend charts, both-direction vault linking, next-to-drop, drag reorder, THE governor boundary (zero sessions/XP/gold/HP/network)
```
(smoke4–smoke14 additionally need `npm install fake-indexeddb` — jsdom ships no IndexedDB.)

Note: both test files resolve `ROOT` via `path.resolve(__dirname, "..")`, so they run from any checkout location. They load every `<script src="…">` in `index.html`; CDN scripts (KaTeX) are marked `defer` so the tests skip them.

**Regenerating spec data** from PDF sources:
```sh
# requires Python 3 + pdfplumber
python tools/parse_aqa.py    # → aqa.json
python tools/parse_maths.py  # → maths.json
python tools/parse_it.py     # → it.json
python tools/gen_data.py     # aqa/maths/it.json → js/data/*.js
```

**Current status & backlog**: see the "SNAPSHOT — 2026-07-05" section at the end of `PROGRESS.md` — prioritised backlog, user-owed manual steps, rough edges (R1–R13), and the test inventory. All 14 suites verified green (smoke14 = Build 3g Purchase/Budget Planner, 2026-07-08).

## INVARIANTS — the one-place list (never violate; details in the sections below)

Collected from every build. If a change would break one of these, stop and say so.

**Governor / economy**
1. Streaks, XP, HP and gold flow ONLY from `KOS.sessions.log(...)` — never write
   them directly.
2. HP/gold gate ONLY labs, sims and the shop. Core revision (spec, notes,
   flashcards, quizzes, exam Qs) never locks. The Focus Timer is never gated.
   Cosmetics stay buyable while strained; only labs suspend.
3. Leisure never touches HP in either direction: media sessions award 0 HP, are
   excluded from the day-drain activity check AND the study streak, and feed
   only the independent rest streak. Reading sessions (`kind:"reading"`) skip
   distraction HP nicks and forfeit nothing on early end.
4. Study streak, rest streak and the HP day-drain activity check are THREE
   separate derivations from the one sessions log: streaks skip
   `focus`+`complete:false` entries; the day-drain still sees them. Keep them
   separate.
5. Bulk operations never log per-entry sessions. One deliberate act = one
   session (games bulk-add; the 3j `sync-reward` session, watermark-filtered
   and capped at 60 XP / 12 gold per sync per module). XML import ignores the
   reward list entirely.
5a. The Purchase/Budget Planner (Build 3g, `wishlist.js`) is OUTSIDE the
   governor entirely — it NEVER calls `KOS.sessions.log` / `KOS.media.logActivity`
   and NEVER moves HP/gold/XP or a streak. Purchasing is logistics, not media
   engagement (smoke14-asserted: a full flow fires zero governor traffic and
   zero network). It also emits ZERO network requests — release dates are
   manual by design.

**Media schema & storage**
6. `mediadb.normalise()` is the SINGLE schema gate — any new field must be
   added there or every `put()` silently strips it. New axes = new DB version
   + migration + indexes.
7. Media entries live in IndexedDB `kurenai-os-media`; attachments in
   `kurenai-os-files`; API tokens in the media kv store. `store.exportFull`/
   `importFull` produce one combined JSON covering all three — tokens
   deliberately excluded. IndexedDB is origin-scoped: `file://` and `localhost`
   vaults are different databases.
8. Views NEVER render the whole vault at once — lazy 60-entry batches via the
   IntersectionObserver sentinel; filters walk real DB indexes, no in-memory
   scans.
9. `bulkUpsert` merge: sync wins on list state, but the manual layer ALWAYS
   survives — Books: `physical`, `mood`, `shelves`, active `dnf`, local
   `author`/`format`; VN: `routes`, `quotes`, `chapters`, `cgGallery`,
   `contentWarnings`, local `developer`. `extra` accretes (fresh non-null
   wins; null never beats stored). Progress re-derives from surviving routes.
10. Derived progress, never stored: `vn` ← routes (cleared/total), `game` ←
    playtimeHours (unit "hr"). Don't add a parallel stored progress.
11. Upsert match order: vndbId first (vn), then anilistId, then malId.
    Title-claim fallback is vn-only, claims only id-less same-title rows,
    never crosses modules.

**Write-back & sync**
12. Push eligibility: ONLY `syncSource:"anilist"` + anilistId (anime/books) or
    `syncSource:"vndb"` + vndbId (vn). Games NEVER push and the games module
    emits ZERO network traffic, ever (smoke8-asserted).
13. Field scoping by construction: push payloads only know status, progress
    (+ volumes for books), score. Nothing else may gain a code path into a
    payload. Local score 0 = unrated → omitted, never clears a remote rating.
14. All remote mutations go through `mediapush.js`/`mediasearch.js` only —
    list state only, no deletes, no favourites, no reviews.
15. `bulkUpsert` (the pull path) never schedules pushes and never logs
    sessions — it returns `res.rewards` for the caller.
16. Last-write-wins is DELIBERATE (stated in Help/Sync & Import) — do not
    bolt on conflict detection as a drive-by.
17. The reward watermark: `put()/add()` absorb it on every local save;
    `bulkUpsert` compares the merged state against it BEFORE absorbing. The
    pinned property (smoke12): a push followed by an echoing pull produces
    ZERO reward events. Below-watermark movement lowers it silently — no
    reward, no clawback. Null watermarks/inserts initialise silently.

**External-API facts (all verified LIVE — do not re-litigate without new facts)**
18. VNDB Kana `/ulist`: the TOP-LEVEL `id` is the VN id; the nested `vn`
    record carries NO id. Mocks must never invent `vn.id` (that's how the 3h
    duplication bug shipped). Official endpoint `api.vndb.org/kana` only —
    never the community proxy.
19. VNDB's CORS preflight allows POST/GET/OPTIONS only — browser PATCH
    (write-back) is blocked regardless of token permissions. The client
    implements the documented shape anyway; don't retry the wall.
20. Steam is a three-way verified dead end (check_authentication response
    unreadable cross-origin; https→file:// return blocked; claimed_id is a
    bare SteamID64). Games stay manual-entry-only; do not re-attempt without
    new facts.
21. Book lookup: Open Library PRIMARY, Google Books FALLBACK ONLY (keyless
    quota is zeroed, 429). Goodreads is dead — never add it.
22. AniList MAL-format XML exports carry MAL ids, not AniList ids (they
    coincide only below ~22k). Rate limits: AniList degraded 30 req/min
    (batch 50, pace ~2.4 s, honour Retry-After); VNDB 200 req/5 min (pace
    ~1.6 s).
23. Airing data is cached in MEMORY only (10-min TTL) — never written to the
    vault, never background-polled. The AniList profile is ONE GraphQL
    request, read-only (`resetNotificationCount: false`).

**Content & UI**
24. `js/data/compsci.js`/`maths.js`/`it.js` are generated — never hand-edit by
    default (caveat: regen via pdfplumber is currently unreliable — the
    committed spec data was cleaned in place in June 2026, so if you must
    regen, diff per-ref against the committed files first).
25. Content keys only on LEAF refs (non-empty `content[]`). Callouts need TWO
    closing braces. No bare-string paragraphs in notes (user preference —
    wrap prose in callouts).
26. Reuse existing class names — engines/views/tests key off them. Restyle
    through `:root` tokens; never repurpose the three subject hues.
27. Navigate only via `KOS.show` (history/forward/rail state). Charts are
    hand-built inline SVG via `KOS.charts` — no charting library.
28. Vault editors live in the `KOS.mediaEditors` registry (keyed by module
    id; anime is the fallback base). `KOS.mediaEditor` (core/media.js)
    dispatches on `entry.module` and then runs `KOS.mediaEditorHooks`
    (each called with `(entry, overlayEl)`) once the modal is in the DOM.
    Never wrap or replace `KOS.mediaEditor` itself — register an editor or
    a hook. Script-tag order between the vault modules no longer matters.
29. VN CG gallery is a COUNTER only — never store/scrape artwork. Content
    warnings are manual — never auto-filled from VNDB tags.

## Architecture

### Script-tag globals, no bundler

All JS is loaded via `<script src="...">` in `index.html` in strict dependency order. Everything shares a single global namespace `KOS`. No `import`/`export` — this is intentional so `file://` works without a server.

### Load order (from `index.html`)

1. **Data** — `js/data/{compsci,maths,it,intel}.js` populate `window.KOS_DATA.*`
2. **Core** — `store.js`, `ui.js`, `content.js`, then `srs.js`, `sessions.js`, `governor.js`, `mediadb.js`, `anilist.js`, `vndb.js`, `bookapi.js`, `media.js`, `mediapush.js`, `autosync.js`
3. **Deep content** — `js/data/content/*.js` populate `window.KOS_CONTENT["subject:ref"]`
4. **Engines** — `js/engines/{flashcards,quiz}.js`
5. **Modules** — `js/modules/hub.js` + `due.js`, `calendar.js`, `todo.js`, `governor-ui.js`, `tracker.js`, `rag.js`, `cardstats.js`, `attachments.js`, `help.js`, `focus.js`, then the four vault views `anime.js`, `books.js`, `vn.js`, `games.js` (each registers its editor in `KOS.mediaEditors` — dispatch lives in core/media.js, so their relative order is free), `aniprofile.js`, `vndbprofile.js`, `wishlist.js` (registers a `KOS.mediaEditorHooks` entry for "on your wishlist" surfacing), `matrix.js`, `shrine.js`, `mediasync.js`, `mediasearch.js`
6. **Labs** — `js/labs/{worked,trace,oop,sims}.js`
7. **Boot** — `js/main.js` wires rail nav, governor boot sequence, restores last view

### Module map & data flow

**Governor spine:**
```
any completed activity ──► KOS.sessions.log({type, subject, ref, dur, metrics})
                                │
              ┌─────────────────┼──────────────────────┐
   governor.onSession       streak derivation      todo/RAG/stats read it
   (pays XP/gold/HP;        (study streak skips    (cardstats, rag.auto,
    media type → 0 HP,       media + incomplete     heatmaps, burn-down)
    rest-streak only)        focus; rest streak
                             = media days only)
```
- `srs.js` owns SM-2 + unified card registry (curriculum `"sid:ref:i"`, custom `"u<id>"`, personal bucket `"personal"`). `governor.js` owns HP/gold/XP/catalog/gates/HUD. `focus.js` owns the ONE timer state machine (`kind:"reading"` for Books). All state in `KOS.store` → localStorage.

**Collection Matrix** (leisure; separate storage, same sessions log):
```
IndexedDB kurenai-os-media (v5) ── mediadb.js owns schema + indexes + bulkUpsert
       │
  media.js — module registry, XML import, logActivity/logSyncRewards,
       │     quickEdit + push chip, dedupeVault
       │
  vault views: anime.js · books.js · vn.js · games.js
  cross-cutting: matrix.js · shrine.js · mediasync.js · mediasearch.js
                 aniprofile.js · vndbprofile.js · wishlist.js
```
- **Off-spine**: `wishlist.js` (Purchase/Budget Planner, 3g) shares the Matrix
  UI chrome but stores in localStorage (`state.wishlist`), not the media vault,
  and NEVER touches the governor or the network — see the detail section below.
- **Read path**: API clients → `bulkUpsert` → `res.rewards` → caller logs ONE sync-reward session. `autosync.js` drives this every 15 min (flush failed pushes first, then pull).
- **Write path**: editors/quick-edit/+1 → `mediadb.put()` (absorbs watermark) → `mediapush.schedule()` (350 ms debounce) → AniList mutation (VNDB CORS-blocked).
- **Watermark loop**: `entry.reward` = last accounted state. `put()` absorbs; `bulkUpsert` diffs BEFORE absorbing — external progress rewards once, echoed push rewards zero.

### Key globals

| Global | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `KOS.store` | Single state object, autosaved to `localStorage` key `kurenai-os-v1` on every mutation |
| `KOS.ui` | `el()` DOM builder, `toast()`, `flashSaved()`, `esc()` (the canonical HTML escaper), `debounce()` |
| `KOS.content` | `get(sid,ref)`, `has(sid,ref)`, `renderBlocks(blocks)`, `coverage(sid,leaves)` |
| `KOS.show(viewId, arg)` | Clears `#main`, calls `KOS.views[viewId](main, arg)`, updates rail active state, saves |
| `KOS.views` | Registry of view render functions; each module registers itself here |
| `KOS_DATA` | Spec tree data (generated — do not hand-edit `compsci/maths/it.js`) |
| `KOS_CONTENT` | Deep revision content keyed by `"subject:ref"` (hand-authored in `js/data/content/`) |

### State shape (`KOS.store.state`)

```js
{
  v: 1,
  progress: {},    // "subject:ref" -> { status, check:[bool,bool,bool,bool], note }
  ui: { subject, view, openSections, lastRef },
  oop: { classes, links, nextId },
  worked: { last },
  trace: {},
  custom: { nextId, cards: [] },        // user flashcards; sid "personal" = non-curriculum bucket
  srs: {},                              // card key -> {ef,ivl,reps,due,last,views,lapses,lastRating}
  sessions: [],                         // study log {id,ts,date,type,subject,ref,dur,metrics} — capped at 2000
  study: { fc: {}, quiz: {} },          // per-topic tallies keyed "sid:ref" (fc: {seen,right,wrong};
                                        // quiz: {attempts,best,lastPct}). Created lazily by the engines,
                                        // NOT in DEFAULTS — but LOAD-BEARING: the home and subject
                                        // dashboards read it for their stat strips. Not legacy.
  governor: { hp, gold, xp, owned, theme, seal, avatar,
              shelfSkin, shrineStyle, lastTick, lastBacklogDrain,
              milestones },             // milestones: lazily-created map of streak-bonus keys → run-start date
  calendar: { nextId, seeded, events, notifyDays, notified },
  todo: { nextId, manual, autoChecked },
  focus: { active, nextId, lastConfig, lastReading },
  tracker: { nextId, entries: [] },
  resources: { nextId, items: [] },
  media: { layout, sort,
           books: { layout, sort, tab, physLayout },
           vn: { layout, sort },
           game: { layout, sort } },
  wishlist: {                             // Build 3g Purchase/Budget Planner
    nextId,
    budget: { monthlyLimit, currency, history:[{month,spent,items:[…]}] },
    items: [ /* {id, module:"books"|"vn"|"game", title, coverUrl, price,
                  currency, retailer, retailerUrl, priority, releaseDate,
                  status, linkedEntryId, notes, addedAt, purchasedAt} */ ]
  }
}
```
File attachments live in IndexedDB `kurenai-os-files`, NOT here — excluded from JSON backup.

### Collection Matrix detail

**Books** — dual-tracking on ONE entry. Top-level fields = digital half; `physical: { owned, volumes: [{number, condition, purchaseDate, price, coverUrl}] }` = physical half. Books-only axes: `author`, `format` (manga|lightNovel|oneShot), `mood`, `shelves`, `dnf`, `progress.volumes/totalVolumes`. Half-star ratings use shared 0–10 score (UI shows /5).
- `normalise()` is the single schema gate; also maps legacy `module:"manga"/"ln"` → `"books"` forever.
- MANGA sync additionally requests `progressVolumes` + staff (author = first Story/Art role, translators excluded).
- Bookshelf spines: `KOS.books.spineColor(title)` — deterministic palette hash. Per-volume covers use canvas-compress (2:3 JPEG base64 in entry).
- Reading heatmap = sessions log filtered to `metrics.module:"books"`, drawn with `KOS.charts.heatmap`.

**Books deepening (3i)** — Physical/Digital is a TAB SPLIT (`media.books.tab`), not a data split. A legacy `layout:"shelf"` pref migrates to Physical tab. The owned%/read% comparison lives in the editor (`.bk-compare`) — keep it there.
- Book lookup: Open Library PRIMARY (`search.json`, covers via `covers.openlibrary.org`; avoids the /isbn/ endpoint — it 302s). Google Books FALLBACK ONLY (keyless quota zeroed). `externalIds.isbn13` is reference-only — not indexed, nothing syncs on it.
- Barcode scanning is capability-detected (`BarcodeDetector` + `getUserMedia` + `ean_13` format check); typed ISBN is the permanent baseline.
- Reading sessions reuse the Focus Timer (`kind:"reading"` — do NOT build a second timer). Logs `type:"media"`, module books, action `"reading-session"`.
- Ranked shelves: membership stays `shelves:[]`; order is per-shelf id lists in media kv (`books.shelfOrder`). Reordering unlocks only in List layout with the shelf as the sole filter. Sort disabled while shelf is selected.

**Visual Novels** — VNDB sync fills title, developer, cover, content-tags-as-genres (category "cont", spoiler 0, rating ≥ 2, top 6), length estimate. Routes are user-built: `routes: [{name, cleared, completedAt}]`; `normalise()` derives progress from them. Other axes: `cgGallery: {totalKnown, unlockedCount}`, `contentWarnings`, `quotes: [{text, context, loggedAt}]`.
- VNDB auth: `Authorization: Token <token>` (personal token, no OAuth); ulist votes 10–100 (÷10 → shared score); labels 1 Playing / 2 Finished / 3 Stalled / 4 Dropped / 5 Wishlist; 6 Blacklist → skip row.
- **Quote → flashcard**: `KOS.srs.addCustom(KOS.srs.PERSONAL_SID, "vn", q, a, {src})` — personal bucket, not a subject. Personal cards ride normal SM-2; study surface is `personaldeck` view.

**Games** — MANUAL-ENTRY ONLY (Steam dead end — see invariant #20). Axes: `publisher`, `completionTier` (notStarted|storyComplete|fullCompletion|platinum|abandoned), `platform` (pc|playstation|xbox|switch|other), `playtimeHours` (null = unknown), `backlogPriority`, `externalIds.steamAppId` (store link only).
- `normalise()` derives progress from playtimeHours (current = hours, total = null, unit "hr").
- Bulk paste-in (`KOS.games.parseBulkTitles`): one title per line → Planned drafts; dedupes within paste and against vault case-insensitively; logs ONE session for the whole paste.
- Editor nudges: tier abandoned → status dropped; any completion tier → completed.

**Anime deepening (3f)** — `KOS.anime.currentSeason(date)`: device date → AniList enum by calendar quarter. Seasonal view filters `extra.season`/`extra.seasonYear`; entries without season data don't appear. Palette via `s-winter|s-spring|s-summer|s-fall` classes.
- Airing data: `KOS.anilist.fetchAiring(ids)` — airingAt unix SECONDS + episode; can be null. Memory-cached 10 min; refreshed on view load + manual ⟳.
- Watch heatmap = same `KOS.charts.heatmap`, sessions filtered to `metrics.module === "anime"`.
- AniList profile (`aniprofile.js`): five tabs (Overview/Favourites/Social/Activity/Notifications) over ONE cached fetch — switching tabs must never refetch. 5-min in-memory cache.

**Sync integrity (3h)**
- `KOS.media.dedupeVault(module, cb)`: merges rows sharing an external id (or title where exactly one id-bearing cluster exists), keeping the UNION of the manual layer; list state follows the freshest copy; ambiguous same-title-different-id rows are never merged. Re-run-safe. Runs once at boot (4 s delay, if `vndb.lastSync` exists, flag `maint.dedupe3h`) and manually from Vault maintenance.
- Import modes: default = update-and-add; "Replace everything from this source" passes `opts.replace = {module, source, protect}` — rows missing from incoming list are deleted UNLESS `hasLocalData` or id is in `protect` (flashcard-referenced entries). Replace never touches other modules or other sources.

**Reward-on-sync + autosync (3j)**
- `bulkUpsert` returns `res.rewards`; sync callers pass to `KOS.media.logSyncRewards(module, events)` — ONE session per sync per module. Governor caps: 60 XP / 12 gold. XML import ignores rewards.
- `STATUS_RANK`: planned 0 · onHold/dropped 1 · inProgress 2 · completed 3. Moving TO dropped never rewards. Below-watermark: lowers silently, no clawback.
- Autosync (`autosync.js`, starts 8 s after boot): AniList anime + manga (2.5 s apart) + VNDB every 15 min, on `online`, on visibilitychange past interval. Cycle: flush stranded FAILED pushes first, then pull. Kill switch: `autosync.enabled` (kv, default ON). Auth failures toast once per session; network failures silent.
- VN chapters: `chapters: [{name, status, notes}]` — parallel to routes, never derived from VNDB, don't drive progress. Completing one logs a "chapter" session (precedence: added > status > route > chapter > quote).
- VNDB profile (`vndbprofile.js`): /ulist_labels + /user length-votes + /stats site totals + vault-derived stats. VNDB has no favourites/followers/activity — the view states that; do not fake parity panels.
- Shop anchors: ~15–30 gold/day steady study → big labs 180, sims 100, themes 140, seals 70, frames 90, Matrix cosmetics 80. `shelfskin` → class on `.bk-shelves`; `shrinestyle` → class on `.shrine-hall`.
- Season picker walks any season/year via `SEASON_ORDER` stepping; palette class follows selection.

**Purchase / Budget Planner (3g)** — `js/modules/wishlist.js`, view `wishlist`, `KOS.wishlist` API. Wishlist across Books/VNs/Games against ONE shared monthly budget pool (never per-module limits). Stored in `state.wishlist` (localStorage), NOT the media vault — these are planning records, not media entries; they ride the standard backup because `exportFull` serialises the whole state object.
- **GOVERNOR BOUNDARY (invariant #5a)**: this module never calls `KOS.sessions.log` / `KOS.media.logActivity`, never moves HP/gold/XP/streaks, and emits ZERO network. smoke14 asserts a full flow leaves all of them untouched. Do not "helpfully" reward purchases.
- Core interaction: `wantToBuy` items carry checkboxes that SIMULATE a purchase — `selectedTotal(ids)` + `remaining(limit, spentThisMonth, selected)` recompute live (can go negative = over budget). Nothing is spent until `markPurchased(id[,ts])`, which flips status, sets `purchasedAt`, and archives a snapshot into `budget.history[month].items` (recomputing `spent`). Idempotent — re-marking never double-archives; items are never deleted on purchase.
- Charts reuse `KOS.charts` only: `spendByMonth()` → spend-over-time bars; `spendByModule()` → per-module split over the shared pool (books vs VN vs games).
- Tabs: Want-to-buy / Waiting-for-release / Purchased. Draggable priority reorder within a tab (`reorder(status, orderedIds)` rewrites `priority` 0..n). `nextToDrop()` = the waiting-for-release item with the nearest UPCOMING manual release date (else most-recent past) — rendered as the hero.
- Linking, BOTH directions: an item's `linkedEntryId` ties it to a vault entry. `forEntry(entryId)` powers the reverse surfacing — `wishlist.js` registers a `KOS.mediaEditorHooks` entry that injects an `.wl-onlist` banner into the editor form when the opened entry is on the wishlist. Module ids match the vault ("game", not "games" — incoming "games" is normalised).
- **Release dates are MANUAL by design** — no viable automated cross-media source: Amazon PA-API needs an approved affiliate account and bars price-watch use, Keepa is a paid per-key subscription, IGDB (games only) needs a Twitch OAuth secret a static `file://` app can't hold and covers no books. The UI says so plainly; don't add a scraper.

**Write-back (3d)** — `js/core/mediapush.js`, list state only (invariants 12–16 apply).
- AniList mutation `SaveMediaListEntry(mediaId, status, progress, progressVolumes, scoreRaw)` — `scoreRaw` (0–100) is used so pushes are independent of user's site scoring format.
- VNDB: `PATCH /ulist/<id>` (vote 10–100, labels_set/unset) — CORS blocks browser PATCH (invariant #19). Client implements the shape anyway; fails with a specific explanation, never "you're offline".
- Debounce 350 ms per entry + queue dedupe by id + read-latest-at-execute.
- Paper trail: every attempt appends to kv `push.log` (cap 200). Success updates `lastSyncedAt`; final failure persists `entry.push:{state:"failed"}` (⚠ retry chip on cards).
- Search-and-add (`mediasearch.js`) is create-then-mirror: confirmed create yields `syncSource` set; otherwise entry lands as `syncSource:"manual"` with its external id kept so a later pull claims it.

**One-time manual setup for live sync:**
- **AniList**: register client at https://anilist.co/settings/developer, Redirect URL = `https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin`, paste Client ID into Sync & Import. Tokens last 1 year.
- **VNDB**: generate personal token at https://vndb.org/u/tokens with "access to my list" (+ "modify my list" for write-back). Paste into Sync & Import. Both tokens live in media DB kv, never localStorage.

### Adding deep revision content

Add to any file under `js/data/content/` (and add a `<script>` tag in `index.html` if creating a new file):

```js
window.KOS_CONTENT["subject:ref"] = {
  notes: [ "paragraph", {h:"Heading"}, {ul:[...]}, {ol:[...]},
           {kv:[["Term","Definition"]]},
           {table:{head:[],rows:[]}},
           {code:{lang:"csharp|sql|pseudo",src:"..."}},
           {callout:{t:"def|tip|warn|miscon|mnemonic|memorise|formula|info", h:"optional header", body:"string or [blocks]"}},
           {steps:[{h:"heading",m:"main text",n:"optional note"}]},
           {worked:{tag:"example|variation|exam|check", title:"...", steps:[{m:"working line",n:"optional why"}], result:"final answer"}},
           {svg:{src:"<svg>…</svg>", cap:"caption"}},
           {page:"Page title"} ],
  flashcards: [["Question","Answer"]],
  quiz: [{q:"...", opts:["a","b"], ans:0, why:"..."}],
  exam: [{q:"...", marks:4, ms:["mark point"]}],
  gens: ["genId"],   // worked-example generator IDs from worked.js
  sims: ["simId"]    // simulation IDs from sims.js
};
```

Badges, tabs, coverage stats, and search pick up the entry automatically. Reuse existing class names — tests key off them (`.study-tab`, `.notes-article`, `.n-call-*`, `.fc-card`, `.qz-opt`, `.logic-tt`, `.sec-card`).

### Adding a new view/module

1. Register: `KOS.views.myView = function(main, arg) { ... }`
2. Add a rail button in `index.html`: `<button class="rail-item" data-view="myView">...</button>`

### Key files to hand-edit

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `js/data/intel.js` | Examiner tips/pitfalls keyed `"subject:ref"` |
| `js/data/content/*.js` | Deep revision content |
| `js/labs/worked.js` | Worked-example generators (push into `GENS` array) |
| `js/labs/trace.js` | Data structure trace lab tabs |
| `js/labs/sims.js` | Simulations |

`js/data/compsci.js`, `maths.js`, `it.js` are **generated** — edit the parsers and re-run `gen_data.py` instead.
